# Claude Workflow Rules

## Development Workflow

1. **Think and Plan First**
   - First think through the problem
   - Read the codebase for relevant files
   - Write a plan to tasks/todo.md

2. **Create Todo List**
   - The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to manage tasks

3. **Verify Plan Before Starting**
   - Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
   - Wait for approval before proceeding

4. **Execute Tasks**
   - Begin working on the todo items
   - Mark them as complete as you go
   - Update the todo list in real-time

5. **Communication**
   - Every step of the way, give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
   - Keep explanations concise and focused

6. **Simplicity First**
   - Make every task and code change as simple as possible
   - Avoid making massive or complex changes
   - Every change should impact as little code as possible
   - Everything is about simplicity

7. **Review and Documentation**
   - Add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of changes made
   - Include any other relevant information about the implementation

## Key Principles

- **Minimalism**: Keep changes small and focused
- **Transparency**: Always communicate what you're doing
- **Planning**: Never start without a clear plan
- **Verification**: Get approval before beginning work
- **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest solution that works
